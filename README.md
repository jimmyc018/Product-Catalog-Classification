# Product-Catalog-Classification
I use MEAN.js (MongoDb, Express, Angular.js and Node.js) to product a front/back end services called Product Catalog Classification.
I used node.js version v6.11.0 because it more stable and some packages for Mean.js isnt compatabile

- bower, grunt, grunt-cli,, gulp, gulp-cli and yo was install via npm (node.js service)
- installed generator-meanjs should be using the latest version (if applicaton doesnt work prefer to use 0.1.12)
- backend service is via MongoDB
